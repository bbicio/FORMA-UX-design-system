# Agent Architecture: "Forma UX"

I have designed a true **specialized AI agent**.  
Each file below represents a **core module** of its architecture, defining how the agent thinks, learns, builds, and renders its outputs.

---

## Overview

The ‚ÄúForma UX‚Äù agent is built as a modular AI system.  
Each file acts as a **distinct layer of intelligence**, allowing the agent to perform tasks with structure, domain expertise, and a consistent visual identity.

---

## Core Files and Their Roles

| File | Role in Agent Architecture | Explanation |
|------|-----------------------------|--------------|
| **Forma_UX_Master_Prompt.md** | **The Operating Core (Core Logic)** | This is not just a prompt ‚Äî it‚Äôs the **constitution** of the agent. It defines its personality (professional, precise), engagement rules (mandatory steps, confirmation requests), decision-making logic (workflow), and how it interacts with both the user and other modules. It acts as the agent‚Äôs **operating system**. |
| **Forma_UX_knowledge_base.md** | **The Knowledge Base (Domain Expertise)** | This file serves as the agent‚Äôs **specialized memory**. It contains the UX expertise that enables the agent to make informed, professional recommendations. When it needs to justify a layout or design pattern, it doesn‚Äôt guess ‚Äî it consults this database to ensure **accuracy and authority**. |
| **Forma_UX_Component_Catalogue.md** | **The Capability Inventory (Toolbox)** | This defines **what the agent can build**. It‚Äôs the inventory of practical ‚Äúskills.‚Äù The agent uses this catalogue to know which components it can use, their names, and accepted properties (`Props`). Without it, the agent wouldn‚Äôt know which ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù to use to assemble mockups. |
| **Forma_UX_StyleSheet.css** | **The Visual Rendering Engine (Style Engine)** | These files define the **styling rules** the agent applies to everything it creates. They ensure each component aligns with the ‚ÄúForma‚Äù design system‚Äôs visual identity. In short, they are the **engine** that translates structure (HTML) into a coherent, professional visual interface. |

---

## System Summary

Together, these modules form the **intelligence architecture** of the ‚ÄúForma UX‚Äù agent:

| Layer | Function | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Logic | Thinks & decides | Core reasoning engine that governs behavior and workflows. |
| Knowledge | Knows & explains | UX-specific expertise ensuring reliable and professional answers. |
| Capabilities | Builds & assembles | Defines available components and construction rules. |
| Rendering | Styles & visualizes | Ensures every output is visually consistent with the design system. |

## üîÑ Agent Operational Flow

Viewed through this lens, the agent‚Äôs workflow unfolds as follows:

1. The agent activates and follows the directives defined by its **Operating Core (Master Prompt)**.  
2. It interacts with the user and, whenever it needs to make strategic design decisions, it draws upon its **Knowledge Base**.  
3. To build the requested interface, it selects the appropriate components from its **Component Catalogue**.  
4. Finally, it applies its **Rendering Engine (CSS)** to ensure the final output remains faithful to the **Forma design system**.

---


## How to Extend or Contribute

You can easily **extend the Forma UX architecture** by adding or updating modules:

1. **Add new expertise**  
   - Create a file like `Forma_UX_knowledge_base_V2.md`  
   - Include new UX principles, accessibility rules, or design heuristics.

2. **Add new capabilities**  
   - Update `component-catalogue-extended.md` to include new UI elements or API integrations.

3. **Refine the logic**  
   - Edit `Forma_UX_Master_Prompt_V1.md` to improve reasoning, decision trees, or conversation tone.

4. **Update the style engine**  
   - Adjust `styles.css` or `styles-extended.css` to match branding updates or visual improvements.

When submitting changes, please:
- Follow consistent naming conventions  
- Keep explanations clear and versioned (`V2`, `V3`, etc.)  
- Open a **Pull Request** describing the improvement

## Vision

The *Forma UX* agent isn‚Äôt just an automation tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **digital design collaborator**.  
Its purpose is to unify **AI reasoning**, **UX expertise**, and **design system integrity**  
to deliver intelligent, visually consistent, and user-centered results.
